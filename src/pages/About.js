                Hello everyone, I am a novice frontend developer with a
                background in sales. I made a career change a year ago, and I
                have been self-taught in JavaScript and React since then. During
                this time, I have been dedicated to learning and mastering these
                technologies through online courses and personal projects. One
                of my proudest achievements is a e-commerce website I built
                using React. It allowed me to apply my understanding of state
                management, reusable components, and API integration. My
                experience in sales has taught me the importance of
                understanding customers' needs, as well as how to effectively
                communicate and collaborate with a team. I believe that these
                skills can be applied to the frontend development field as well,
                where creating a positive user experience is key. I am eager to
                continue learning and growing as a frontend developer. I am a
                quick learner, highly motivated and passionate about delivering
                quality work. I believe that my determination and ability to
                adapt to new challenges make me a valuable asset to any team.
                Thank you for considering me for this opportunity. I am
                confident that my passion for frontend development, combined
                with my background in sales, will bring a unique perspective and
                valuable skills to your projects.
